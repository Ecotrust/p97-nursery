# nursery

Point 97 code nursery. 

Serves as a nursery for code that does not yet constitute it's own dedicated modules, without becoming an orphanage for code that doesn't belong anywhere else. 

## Do’s and Don’t’s: 

Do put code in here that doesn't fit within any known modules. Even if it's just one function, build a module for it as though it were a fully grown library. 

Don't drop code off here never to return. This may create future emotional problems for the code.
